He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
The sun was blinding; Channing Tatum blinked in the harsh light, trying to focus.
All alone on the beach he felt so lonely but in the distance he could see someone
coming near. Who could this be? Someone Channing Tatum knows? could it be Jenna Dewan Tatum?
It was not Jenna, but an old friend he hadn't seen in years. At that point, the fun began.
Channing took the his old friend out for some ice cream. It was a jubilant time, afterwards Channing went home and slept like a baby.
